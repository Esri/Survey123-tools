    "A common ArcGIS Survey123 workflow is to export survey data as a `.xlsx` file and work with that data in other software. A limitation of exporting data from your ArcGIS organization in Microsoft Excel format is that the attachments are not included. The only way to include attachments when exporting a dataset from the Survey123 website, ArcGIS Online, or ArcGIS Enterprise is to export it as a file geodatabase, but this method still requires additional work to extract the attachments.\n",

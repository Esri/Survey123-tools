# Survey123 Tools

A collection of tools and scripts that you can use to automate, optimise and enhance your use of Survey123. 

## How to use these tools

To use these tools either clone or download the contents of this repo.

## Guide vs Task

**Guides** are designed to describe how to use the [Survey123 module](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/api-reference/arcgis.apps.survey123.html) in the [ArcGIS API for Python](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/) to write Python scripts, incorporating capabilities such as connecting to your survey, working with survey data, and creating reports. 

**Tasks** presented here demonstrate various ArcGIS Survey123 workflows that can be automated to enhance your Survey123 experience. Tasks are in the form of a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html), that can be viewed online, or downloaded and run interactively. The workflows demonstrated in the notebooks designated as tasks can be exported as a script and run at regular intervals using [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/geoprocessing/basics/schedule-geoprocessing-tools.htm), or the notebook can be uploaded to your [ArcGIS organization and scheduled](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/prepare-a-notebook-for-automated-execution.htm). 

## Requirements

Each tool is in its own folder, and includes an individual readme file which describes the purpose of the tool and what environment it should be used in. Some tools are python scripts designed to run on the command line, others are shared as Notebooks.

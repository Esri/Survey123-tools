    "ArcGIS Survey123 uses attachment keywords to associate an attachment in a feature layer with its corresponding image, file, or audio question in a survey. Attachment keywords are supported for hosted feature layers in ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise version 10.8.1 and later.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the <a href=\"https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-survey123-blog/understanding-survey123-feature-reports/ba-p/897659\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Survey123 Feature Reports</a> blog post, attachments such as photos, signatures, and annotated images are not supported in reports when using ArcGIS Enterprise version 10.8 or earlier. This is because report templates rely on attachment keywords to place image questions in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue you may run into after upgrading your ArcGIS Enterprise deployment to 10.8.1 or later is that attachments still do not print in reports. The reason for this is that even though the environment is upgraded, the upgrade process does not automatically associate attachments with Survey123 questions, nor does it automatically enable keywords in the attachment table. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to automate the workflow for updating attachment keywords after upgrading to ArcGIS Enterprise version 10.8.1 or later. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script assumes all attachments were captured or uploaded in the Survey123 field app or captured in the Survey123 web app (but not uploaded in the web app).\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted earlier, attachment keywords are not automatically enabled in the attachment table for a hosted feature service in ArcGIS Enterprise or a feature service registered with an enterprise geodatabase. An option to enable keywords is anticipated with ArcGIS Enterprise version 10.9. Until then, a prerequisite to running this notebook is to enable attachment keywords on your feature service manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable attachment keywords on a hosted feature service, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the hosted feature service as a file geodatabase.\n",
    "1. Open the file geodatabase in ArcGIS Pro.\n",
    "1. Run the <a href=\"https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/upgrade-attachments.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Upgrade Attachments</a> geoprocessing tool on all layers in the file geodatabase that contain attachments.\n",
    "1. Overwrite the hosted feature service in your ArcGIS Enterprise portal with the updated file geodatabase.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a feature service that points to an enterprise geodatabase, run the Upgrade Attachments tool on the attachment table directly."
